# Introduction to Deep Learning

Deep Learning is at the cutting edge of what machines can do, and developers and business leaders absolutely need to understand what it is and how it works. This unique type of algorithm has far surpassed any previous benchmarks for classification of images, text, and voice.

It also powers some of the most interesting applications in the world, like autonomous vehicles and real-time translation. There was certainly a bunch of excitement around Google’s Deep Learning based AlphaGo beating the best Go player in the world, but the business applications for this technology are more immediate and potentially more impactful. This post will break down where Deep Learning fits into the ecosystem, how it works, and why it matters.

In the DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate program, you'll get hands-on experience through 16 Python programming assignments. By the end of this program, you will be ready to:

- Build and train neural networks using TensorFlow

- Improve your network’s performance using convolutions as you train it to identify real-world images

- Teach machines to understand, analyze, and respond to human speech with natural language processing systems

- Process text, represent sentences as vectors, and train a model to create original poetry!
